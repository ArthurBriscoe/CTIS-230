<h5> Hobbies/ interests</h5>
<p> - I enjoy going to the gym on a regular basis and plan on taking it far.
<p>   <strong>The gym has helped me to get out of dark places mentally and gave me a reason to not just drop and give up.</strong></p>
<p> - I like to socialize with my friends late at night just talking about life and what it could be or what we make
      it out to be. <strong>It's hard to describe the feeling of comfortability when i'm around my homies.</strong> 
      It's like all of my problems just disappear when i'm around them. I also get this feeling when i'm in the gym.
</p>
<h3> Life time Goals</h3>
<p><strong> - Retiring my parents. </strong>
<p><strong> - Watching my brother and sister grow up to be the people they want to be and become successful. </strong></p>
<p><strong> - Being financially stable so money is never a problem for my future family and future self. </strong></p>
